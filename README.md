Cryptopals.com solutions in Rust
================================

These are my solutions to The Matasano Crypto Challenges in Rust.
So far I've finished the qualifying [Set 1](http://cryptopals.com/sets/1/).

The challenges are solved as normal rust unit tests so:
`cargo test`  
to see them pass. If you want to see spoilers I log some of the decrypted
solutions which can be seen with:  
`cargo test -- --nocapture`
